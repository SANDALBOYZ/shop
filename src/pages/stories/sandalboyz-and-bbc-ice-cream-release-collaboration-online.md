      Coming off of the sell out success of their collaboration sandal in New
      York City at the Manhattan Billionaire Boys Club flagship store,
      SANDALBOYZ and BBC announce the online release of the highly sought after
      product. The sandal will drop on Saturday, September 9th at 11 AM Pacific
      Time exclusively at www.sandalboyz.com and www.bbcicecream.com. Both
      parties will be shipping worldwide, so this provides an opportunity for
      folks everywhere to get their hands on the collaboration. However,
      quantities will be limited. The sandal is, in part, a homage from the
      SANDALBOYZ owners to BBC’s influence on modern day streetwear/fashion
      culture. The collaboration sandal features a solid “sand” colorway with
      the classic and iconic Diamonds and Dollar signs pattern on the strap.
