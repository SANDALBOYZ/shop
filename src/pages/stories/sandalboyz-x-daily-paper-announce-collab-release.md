      The sandal sports an all white colorway (white sole and white strap) with
      Daily Paper’s insignia on the strap. The strap also features a high
      density UV print of Daily Paper’s own African heritage inspired pattern. 


      Earlier this month, SANDALBOYZ and Daily Paper held up a pop-up at the
      Daily Paper brick and mortar in Amsterdam to celebrate the opening of
      Daily Paper’s footwear space along with a Netherlands exclusive release of
      the sandal. The sandals received a warm welcome just in time for the Dutch
      Summer.


      The sandal will see a US release online at www.sandalboyz.com on 24 June
      2017, 11:00 AM Pacific Time. It will retail for $65 USD. SANDALBOYZ will
      continue to offer free shipping and free returns for all orders placed in
      the United States and free shipping on orders over $150 USD for
      international orders.

      SANDALBOYZ is a movement and lifestyle, existing to bridge the gap between
      sophistication and comfort. Coming from humble beginnings in 2015 as an
      interest group for the leisurely yet urbane lifestyle surrounding slides,
      SANDALBOYZ has grown and seen itself on the likes of Migos, Kylie Jenner,
      Lewis Hamilton, Cassie, Nick Young, and more.
