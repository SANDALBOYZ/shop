      Abbas Hamad, known by his stage name Bas, is a Sudanese-American rapper
      hailing from Queens, New York. He was born in Paris to Sudanese immigrant
      parents. His family moved to Qatar briefly before finally setting in New
      York. Bas refers to having been raised as a “third culture kid.” It is
      apparent that this unique upbringing has had a positive effect on his
      identity.
