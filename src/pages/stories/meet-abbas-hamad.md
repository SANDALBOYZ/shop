      Abbas Hamad, known by his stage name Bas, is a Sudanese-American rapper
      hailing from Queens, New York. He was born in Paris to Sudanese immigrant
      parents. His family moved to Qatar briefly before finally setting in New
      York. Bas refers to having been raised as a “third culture kid.” It is
      apparent that this unique upbringing has had a positive effect on his
      identity.

      # This is H1


      In 2014, Bas dropped his debut studio album with Dreamville titled Last
      Winter executively produced by J. Cole. In 2016, he followed up with
      critically acclaimed Too High To Riot on the same imprint. The sophomore
      album’s title and content are indicative of the warm yet cool and
      confident demeanor that Bas exudes. Bas possesses eloquent lyricism with a
      laidback flow. His songs, often drawing from multicultural inspirations
      such as afro beat and French house, stand out in a landscape of hip-hop
      that is currently dominated by Atlanta-style rap laden with money,
      misogyny, and flaunting consumerism. It is the above combination of good
      energy that drew us to Bas and led to a collaboration that made sense.


      **Here is a bold block.**


      _I am italicized._


      We chose to debut our BE YOU program with Bas not only due to an existing
      good relationship but also to the the fact that Bas strongly embodies many
      our SANDALBOYZ core tenets
