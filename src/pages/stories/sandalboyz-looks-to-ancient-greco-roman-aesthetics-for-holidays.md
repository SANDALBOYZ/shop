      The sandal team from Los Angeles continues their fascination with the
      tradition of monogramming. Since their conception, the company has been
      inspired by traditional forms of design and decoration. The monogram’s
      origin dates back to Greek and Roman rulers, who used the monogram as a
      signature of their reign. The modern monogram can be seen on the
      ubiquitous fashion houses of our day, and it is no secret that SANDALBOYZ
      has drawn influence from these places in the past. The Holiday 2018
      collection titled, “An Exploration of Monograms” exhibits a regal approach
      on the modern day classic slide sandal.

      The collection comes in 3 colorways. The black colorway was an exclusive
      that is no longer in stock. Oxblood, available on the website now, is a
      deep burgundy sandal perfect for the holidays. Hunter Green will be
      releasing on Saturday, December 8 at 11 AM PST. All sandals feature a gold
      foil printing process that is extremely difficult to master. The sandals
      retail at $65 USD.
